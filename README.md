## The importance of my project
Many people around the world prefer to shop online and buy products from different websites.
With the help of the new technology of the internet, my project helps people from all around the world to be able purchase items online by simply sitting in their homes or offices. Purchasing items online is a very easy task to do. It plays a very important role in our lives especially elderly people, disabled people as well as people with a busy life. It provides a very comfortable service for the user, by being able to save the item in the personal shopping cart, and buy it later on.
